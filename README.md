# math_library

header-only math library for computer graphics. Uses SIMD set instructions

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting C++20 (or later)
- CPU with the following SIMD support (at least one of them): AVX 2, AVX, SSE 4.2, SSE 4.1, SSSE3, SSE 3

---

### Features:

- generates macros during build of the project for choosing the best SIMD instruction set for your CPU
- uses SIMD instructions for faster calculations
- header-only library (but you can build it as a static library if you want - just need to add .cpp file)
- uses C++20 features (concepts)
- uses CMake for building
- uses Google Test for unit testing
- uses Doxygen for documentation
- uses Google Benchmark for benchmarking
- uses spdlog for logging (for now not used, but will be used in the future)
- implements both row-major and column-major matrices
- implements both left-handed and right-handed coordinate systems
- uses clang format for enforcing a consistent code style and formatting
- uses clang tidy for static code analysis and catching potential bugs and style issues
- implements various variables and functions for graphics (such as view, perspective/orthogonal projection matrix) with different configurations (row/column major, left/right hand/ different depth for projection matrices etc.)

### Classes

- Matrix
- Vector
- Point
- Dimension

### Third parties:

- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - currently not used

---

### How to build:

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone git@github.com:vadymchan/math_library.git`
2. Build project:
   ` cmake .`
   P.S. You can use cmake-gui for more comfortable building (and there you can choose options like build with third parties or not)

---

### Examples:

No examples for now, but you can look at tests and benchmarks for examples of usage

---

### TODO:

- [ ] add more tests (currently not tested different types (only float was tested), SIMD instruction (only AVX was tested)
- [ ] add more benchmarks (the same as with tests)
- [ ] add more documentation (currently no documentation at all =) )
- [ ] add logging (currently no logging at all =) )

P.S. for some elements i'm still not sure:

- for class methods do i really need to add `s_` prefix ðŸ¤”
- do i need to add `s_k`, `g_k` prefixes ðŸ¤”

### Issues

#### include in other project using CMake FetchContent and math_library build as header only library

this problem occurs since math_library is header only library (INTERFACE), so it doesn't have to build before the main project. But math_library dependent on run_generate_defines which generates
simd_defines.h file for internal use. So if math_library is not built before the main project, then simd_defines.h is not generated and math_library can't be used.

Solution:
add to CMakeLists.txt of the main project where you want to use math_library:

```cmake
add_dependency (<project_name> math_library)
```

this will forcefully build math_library (specifically run_generate_defines) before the main project.
